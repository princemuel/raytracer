# Ray Tracer Challenge

![CI Status][ci-badge]

A **ray tracer project implemented in Rust**. It is inspired by [_The Ray Tracer Challenge_][rtc-challenge] by Jamis Buck. The book provides pseudocode and test cases; the implementation is left to the reader.

## Overview

This project serves two purposes:

- **Showcase**: demonstrate progress in building a ray tracer step by step.
- **Learning log**: capture insights about Rust, graphics programming, and math along the way.

## What is Ray Tracing?

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates how light interacts with objects and materials to produce highly realistic images.  
Itâ€™s powerful for accuracy but computationally expensive.

## Features

- [ ] Chapter 01: fjfjjfjf

## Run

```sh
cargo run --release
```

## Screenshots

<!-- _(Example renders go here â€” from first spheres to more complex scenes. Show progress, not just final results.)_ -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] Basic rayâ€“sphere renderer
- [ ] Shadows & multiple light sources
- [ ] Reflections & refractions
- [ ] Additional primitives: planes, cubes, cylinders, cones etc
- [ ] Patterned materials (stripes, gradients, checkers, perturbed textures)
- [ ] Complex scenes with multiple objects and light sources
- [ ] Performance optimizations (bounding volume hierarchy, parallelism, SIMD?)
- [ ] Full test coverage with language-agnostic examples from the book
- [ ] Comprehensive Rust documentation (`cargo doc` with examples)
- [ ] Project restructuring to target **WebAssembly**
- [ ] Build a web app frontend to generate 3D images interactively
- [ ] Publish online demo with examples and benchmarks

## Learning Notes

Things Iâ€™ve learned while working on this project:

- Rustâ€™s **ownership model** pushed me toward cleaner data flow between rays, geometry, and scenes.
- Writing **matrix math** from scratch clarified transformations and coordinate systems.
- Debugging intersections required intermediate visualizations (like surface normals).
- Translating pseudocode into idiomatic Rust often meant rethinking data structures.
